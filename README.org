** Contributing 

Our goal is to make contributing the easiest possible, so there two methods to send your article.

*** New Issue 

This is the quick and easy method. Just create an issue and upload your article using markdown or orgmode format. Your file will be added here as soon as possible.

*** Pull request

This is a little bit more complex but may be preferred if the author is used to this git feature. The main advantage is that the author will be included in the contributors page in the repo.
